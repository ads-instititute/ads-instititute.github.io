We are very happy to announce that Yin Tat Lee (ADSI coPI), along with a team of researchers that includes ADSI member [Sebastien Bubeck](http://sbubeck.com/) of Microsoft Research, has won the Best Paper Award at the 32nd Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2018. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00291) presents two new algorithms that achieve optimal convergence rates for optimizing non-smooth convex functions in distributed networks.
