[The ADSI Summer School on Foundations of Data Science](https://alecgt.github.io/adsi_summer/) was organized by U. Washington and U.W. Madison over 4.5 days (August 13-17, 2019) at the University of Washington in Seattle. The event gave a large and advanced introduction to fundamental aspects of data science, including stochastic optimization, convex optimization, convex geometry and sampling, computational imaging, deep generative models, fairness in machine learning, reinforcement learning and active machine learning. The format was mostly lectures accompanied with notes. They were generally organized by a first part covering basic concepts and a second part introducing present research with an emphasis on recent discoveries of fundamental principles. An interactive lab was also conducted in computational imaging.

The target audience was graduate students and postdocs, with some knowledge of some of the fundamental areas of data science, but a desire to learn about other topics in the area. 
Lecturers included Paquette (U. Waterloo); Diakonikolas, Hardt (U.C. Berkeley); Lee, Jamieson, Oh (U. Washington); Nowak (U.W. Madison); Willett (U. Chicago); Agarwal (Microsoft Research). A poster session was also organised at which about 10 participants presented their research.

About 50 people registered for the summer school, the total number of participants was about 65. Of these, 40 were from U. Washington, 7 from U.W. Madison, the others belong to U.C. Berkeley (2), U. Chicago (2), U. Waterloo (1), Microsoft Research (1), Northeastern University (2), U.A. Tucson (1), Princeton (1), U.I. Urbana Champaign (1), U. Michigan (3), U.C. South California (2), U. Vienna (1), US AirForce (1), Harvard (1). One third of the invited speakers were women and at least one fifth of the registered participants were women. The majority of the summer school attendees were advanced graduate students and postdocs that felt prepared for the summer school. A small number were graduate students earlier in their career (but who had some background in relevant areas), young faculty, and established researchers or practitioners (for example, those from Air Force labs).
