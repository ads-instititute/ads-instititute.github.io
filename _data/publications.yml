      title: The nonsmooth landscape of phase retrieval
      journal: arXiv abs/1711.03247
      url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03247
      highlight: This paper shows that the standard Polyak subgradient method converges linearly for the phase retrieval problem, when initialized within a constant relative distance of the underlying signal. The second part of the paper analyzes concentration of stationary points of the subsampled objective.
