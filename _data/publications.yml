      title: An homotopy method for lp regression provably beyond self-concordance and in input-sparsity time
      journal: arXiv abs/1711.01328

      highlight: Solving two open problems about lp ball, the simplest object in convex optimization. First is the existence of input sparsity time algorithm for lp regression, second is the inexistence of good self-concordance barrier. The later question has been open since the invention of self-concordance theory.
